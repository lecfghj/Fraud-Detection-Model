# Fraud-Detection-Model
Project Overview:
In this project, I developed a robust machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset, the objective was to classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent, thereby minimizing financial losses and enhancing security for consumers and financial institutions.

Key Steps and Methodologies:
Data Exploration and Preprocessing:

Analyzed the dataset to understand its structure and identify any issues such as missing values or outliers.
Conducted feature engineering to enhance the dataset by transforming and scaling features appropriately, ensuring optimal model performance.
Dimensionality Reduction with PCA:

Implemented Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality while retaining key features that capture significant variance in the data.
Analyzed the explained variance ratio of principal components to determine the most informative features for classification, ensuring efficient model training and improved interpretability.
Handling Class Imbalance:

Employed various resampling techniques, including Random OverSampling (ROS) and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), to address class imbalance inherent in the dataset.
Applied ensemble methods, such as SMOTEENN, to create a balanced training dataset, improving the model's ability to identify fraudulent transactions.
Model Development and Evaluation:

Trained multiple machine learning algorithms, including LightGBM, to find the most effective model for the classification task.
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, ensuring a comprehensive assessment of model effectiveness in identifying fraud.
Visualization and Reporting:

Visualized key insights, including the distribution of transaction classes, feature importance, and cumulative explained variance from PCA, to enhance understanding of the data and model performance.
Compiled a detailed report summarizing findings, methodologies, and recommendations for future improvements.
Results:
The final model demonstrated high accuracy and a strong ability to predict fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives. The insights gained from the data exploration and PCA analysis highlighted critical factors associated with fraudulent activities, providing valuable information for stakeholders in the financial sector.
